# Nightpane

Nightpane is an hobby operating system im working on to learn the basics of OSDEV and the basics of the x86_64 Architecture


Its only goal is to be a fun little playground for me to learn basic osdev/low level knowledge, not a serious operating system


This current code is a rewrite of the older code (which i wrote when i didn't even know basic stuff about the architecture) so its pretty barebones and unfinished in its current state but hopefully by febuary or march it can be more usable
